**HTML elements** have properties, for example the HTML elemet inputbox has the tag <input> and the property type="text"
**https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input**

## 1. Anatomy of a component

Every component must have:

A **TypeScript class** with behaviors such as handling user input and fetching data from a server

An **HTML template** that controls what renders into the DOM

A **CSS selector** that defines how the component is used in HTML

You provide Angular-specific information for a component by adding a **@Component** decorator on top of the TypeScript class:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  template: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo">`,
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
```

For full details on writing Angular templates, see the **Templates guide**(https://angular.dev/guide/templates).

The object passed to the @Component decorator is called the **component's metadata**. This includes the **selector**, **template**, and other **properties** described throughout this guide.

Components can optionally include a list of CSS styles that apply to that component's DOM:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  template: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo">`,
  styles: `img { border-radius: 50%; }`,
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
```

By default, a component's styles only affect elements defined in that component's template. See Styling Components for details on Angular's approach to styling.

You can alternatively choose to write your **template and styles in separate files**:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  templateUrl: 'profile-photo.html',
  styleUrl: 'profile-photo.css',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
```

This can help separate the concerns of presentation from behavior in your project. You can choose one approach for your entire project, or you decide which to use for each component.

Both **templateUrl** and **styleUrl** are relative to the directory in which the component resides.

## 2. Using components

Every component defines a **CSS selector**:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  ...
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
```

See **Component Selectors** for details about which types of selectors Angular supports and guidance on choosing a selector.

You use a component by creating a matching HTML element in the template of other components:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'user-profile',
  template: `
    <profile-photo />
    <button>Upload a new profile photo</button>`,
  ...,
})
export class UserProfile { }
```

See Importing and using components for details on how to reference and use other components in your template.

Angular creates an instance of the component for every matching HTML element it encounters. 

The DOM element that matches a component's selector is referred to as that component's host element. The contents of a component's template are rendered inside its host element.

The **DOM** rendered by a component, corresponding to that **component's template**, is called that **component's view**.

In composing components in this way, you can think of **your Angular application as a tree of components**.

This tree structure is important to understanding several other Angular concepts, including **dependency injection** and **child queries**.

## 3. Importing and using components

Angular supports two ways of making a component available to other components: as a **standalone component** or in an **NgModule**.

### 3.1. Standalone components

A **standalone component** is a component that sets **standalone: true** in its component metadata. 

Standalone components directly import other components, directives, and pipes used in their templates:

```typescript
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'profile-photo',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  imports: [ProfilePhoto],
  template: `<profile-photo />`
})
export class UserProfile { }
```

Standalone components are directly importable into other standalone components.

The Angular team recommends using standalone components for all new development.

### 3.2. NgModules

Angular code that predates standalone components uses NgModule as a mechanism for importing and using other components. See the full NgModule guide for details.

## 4. Component selectors

Every component defines a **CSS selector** that determines how the component is used:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  ...
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
```

You use a component by creating a matching **HTML element** in the templates of other components:

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <profile-photo />
    <button>Upload a new profile photo</button>`,
  ...,
})
export class UserProfile { }
```

Angular matches selectors statically at compile-time. Changing the DOM at run-time, either via Angular bindings or with DOM APIs, does not affect the components rendered.

An element can match exactly one component selector. If multiple component selectors match a single element, Angular reports an error.

Component selectors are **case-sensitive**.

### 4.1 Types of selectors

Angular supports a limited subset of basic CSS selector types in component selectors:

**Type selector**:	Matches elements based on their **HTML tag name**, or **node name**.

**Attribute selector**Â¨: Matches elements based on the presence of an **HTML attribute** and, optionally, an exact **value for that attribute**.

**Class selector**:	Matches elements based on the presence of a **CSS class**.

For attribute values, Angular supports matching an exact attribute value with the equals (=) operator. Angular does not support other attribute value operators.

Angular component selectors do not support combinators, including the descendant combinator or child combinator.

Angular component selectors do not support specifying namespaces.

### 4.2. Selectors samples

#### Element Selector

The **element selector** is the most common and straightforward type of selector. 

It allows you to use the component as an HTML element within your templates.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `<p>Hello from My Component!</p>`,
})
export class MyComponent {}
```

Usage in HTML:

```html
Copy code
<app-my-component></app-my-component>
```

#### Attribute Selector

You can also define a selector as an attribute. 

This is useful when you want to attach behavior or styling to existing elements without changing the HTML structure significantly.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: '[appHighlight]',
  template: `<p>This paragraph will be styled with appHighlight.</p>`,
})
export class HighlightComponent {}
```

Usage in HTML:

```html
<p appHighlight>This text will be highlighted.</p>
```

#### Class Selector

Angular components can also be selected by CSS class. 

This is less common but might be useful in scenarios where you want to apply component behavior based on CSS classes.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: '.app-my-class',
  template: `<p>This component is selected by class!</p>`,
})
export class MyClassComponent {}
Usage in HTML:

```html
<div class="app-my-class"></div>
```

Note: While class selectors can be used, they're generally not recommended for components because Angular adds and removes these classes dynamically, which can interfere with styling and component functionality.

#### Combination Selector

You can combine multiple selectors using a comma to apply a component or directive in different ways. This allows for flexible usage of components across your application.

```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: 'input[appAutoFocus], textarea[appAutoFocus]',
})
export class AutoFocusDirective {
  // Directive logic here
}
```

Usage in HTML:

```html
<input appAutoFocus type="text">
<textarea appAutoFocus></textarea>
```

This directive can be applied to both **input** and **textarea** elements that have the **appAutoFocus attribute**.

**Summary**

**Element selectors** are used to define new elements in your application.

**Attribute selectors** are useful for adding behavior to existing elements without changing their type.

**Class selectors** are less common and not recommended for components due to potential dynamic class manipulation by Angular.

**Combination selectors** offer flexibility in how components or directives can be applied, allowing them to work in multiple contexts.

**Selectors** provide a powerful way to define how and where your components and directives are applied, enabling you to build more modular and reusable Angular applications.

### 4.3. The :not pseudo-class

Angular supports the **:not pseudo-class**. You can append this pseudo-class to any other selector to narrow which elements a component's selector matches. 

For example, you could define a **[dropzone] attribute selector** and prevent matching textarea elements:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: '[dropzone]:not(textarea)',
  ...
})
export class DropZone { }
```

Angular does not support any other pseudo-classes or pseudo-elements in component selectors.

### 4.4. Combining selectors

You can combine multiple selectors by concatenating them. For example, you can match <button> elements that specify type="reset":

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'button[type="reset"]',
  ...
})
export class ResetButton { }
```

You can also define multiple selectors with a comma-separated list:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'drop-zone, [dropzone]',
  ...
})
export class DropZone { }
```

Angular creates a component for each element that matches any of the selectors in the list.

### 4.5. When to use an attribute selector

You should consider an attribute selector when you want to create a component on a standard native element.

For example, if you want to create a custom button component, you can take advantage of the standard <button> element by using an attribute selector:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'button[yt-upload]',
   ...
})
export class YouTubeUploadButton { }
```

```html
<button yt-upload="true">Upload Video</button>
```
## 5. Styling components

Components can optionally include **CSS styles** that apply to that **component's DOM**:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  template: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo">`,
  styles: ` img { border-radius: 50%; } `,
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
```

You can also choose to write your styles in **separate files**:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  templateUrl: 'profile-photo.html',
  styleUrl: 'profile-photo.css',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
```

When Angular compiles your component, these styles are emitted with your component's JavaScript output.

This means that component styles participate in the JavaScript module system. When you render an Angular component, the framework automatically includes its associated styles, even when lazy-loading a component.

### 5.1  Style scoping

In Angular, style scoping refers to the application of CSS styles in a way that they only affect a specific component, rather than leaking out and impacting other elements or components within the application. This is achieved through Angular's view encapsulation mechanism.

Angular offers three kinds of view encapsulation:

Emulated (the default): Styles defined in a component's CSS file are scoped to that component. Angular achieves this by transforming the CSS selectors to target only the specific component's template and adding special attributes to the component's elements.

None: No style encapsulation is applied. Styles defined in a component's CSS file can affect other components' templates if the selectors match. This is essentially like global styles.

ShadowDom: Uses the browser's native Shadow DOM technology to encapsulate styles. Styles defined in a component's CSS file are applied to the component's template within a shadow DOM.

#### 5.1.1. Emulated Encapsulation

In emulated mode, Angular modifies the CSS selectors and adds attributes to elements of the component to ensure styles are scoped. For instance:

```typescript
// app.component.ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated // This is default, so it can be omitted
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'angular-style-scoping';
}
```

```css
/* app.component.css */
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<h1>Welcome to Angular Style Scoping!</h1>
```

Angular transforms the CSS and template so that the h1 style only applies to the h1 within AppComponent.

#### 5.1.2. None Encapsulation

Using ViewEncapsulation.None means styles can bleed out to other components.

```typescript
// app.component.ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'angular-style-scoping';
}
```

In this case, the h1 style in app.component.css can affect h1 elements in other components.

#### 5.1.3. ShadowDom Encapsulation

When using ShadowDom, styles are scoped to the component by the browser's shadow DOM.

```typescript
// app.component.ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'angular-style-scoping';
}
```

This approach uses the browser's built-in shadow DOM to encapsulate styles. 

The h1 style in app.component.css will only affect h1 elements inside the shadow DOM of AppComponent.

**Conclusion**

Angular's style scoping allows for a modular and encapsulated approach to styling components, making it easier to manage styles in a large application without worrying about styles clashing or leaking across components.

Depending on the project requirements and browser support, you can choose the encapsulation strategy that best fits your needs.

### 5.2. ::ng-deep

Angular's emulated encapsulation mode supports a custom pseudo class, :ng-deep. 

Applying this pseudo class to a CSS rule disables encapsulation for that rule, effectively turning it into a global style. 

The Angular team strongly discourages new use of ::ng-deep. These APIs remain exclusively for backwards compatibility.

### 5.3. Defining styles in templates

You can use the **<style>** element in a component's template to define additional styles. 

The component's view encapsulation mode applies to styles defined this way.

Angular does not support bindings inside of style elements.

### 5.4. Referencing external style files

Component templates can use the **<link>** element to **reference CSS files**. 

Additionally, your CSS may use the **@importat-rule** to reference CSS files. 

Angular treats these references as external styles. 

External styles are not affected by emulated view encapsulation.
